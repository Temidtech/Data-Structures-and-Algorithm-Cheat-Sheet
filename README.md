## Data Structures

> **ARRAYS**

| Operation | Time Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Access    | O(1)            |
| Insert    | O(n)            |
| Search    | O(n)            |
| Delete    | O(n)            |

> **HASH MAPS**

Maps, dictionaries, and associative arrays all describe the same abstract data type. But hash map implementations are distinct from treemap implementations in that one uses a hash table and one uses a binary search tree.
There are at least two ways to implement hashmap:

1. Array: Using a hash function to map a key to the array index value. Worst Case: O(n), Average Case: O(1).
2. Binary Search Tree: using a self-balancing binary search tree to look up for values. Worst Case: O(log n), Average Case: O(log n).

| Operation | Time Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Access    | O(1)            |
| Insert    | O(1)            |
| Search    | O(1)            |
| Delete    | O(1)            |

> **LINKED LIST**

 A linked list is the most sought-after data structure when it comes to handling dynamic data elements. A linked list consists of a data element known as a node. And each node consists of two fields: one field has data, and in the second field, the node has an address that keeps a reference to the next node.

| Operation | Time Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Access    | O(n)            |
| Insert    | O(n)            |
| Search    | O(n)            |
| Delete    | O(n)            |
