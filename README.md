## Data Structures
> **ARRAYS**

| Operation | Time Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Access    |      O(1)       |   
| Insert    |      O(n)       |
| Search    |      O(n)       |
| Delete    |      O(n)       |

> **HASH MAPS**

Maps, dictionaries, and associative arrays all describe the same abstract data type. But hash map implementations are distinct from treemap implementations in that one uses a hash table and one uses a binary search tree.
There are at least two ways to implement hashmap-:

1. Array: Using a hash function to map a key to the array index value. Worst Case: O(n), Average Case: O(1).
2. Binary Search Tree: using a self-balancing binary search tree to look up for values. Worst Case: O(log n), Average Case: O(log n).

| Operation | Time Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Access    |      O(1)       |
| Insert    |      O(1)       |
| Search    |      O(1)       |
| Delete    |      O(1)       |
